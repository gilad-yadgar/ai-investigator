# Build After Code Changes

When modifying TypeScript, JavaScript, or related source files, always run a build command after completing the changes to ensure the code compiles properly.

## Build Commands Available:
- `npm run build-dev` - Development build (faster, recommended for testing compilation)
- `npm run build-prod` - Production build (slower, optimized)

## Required Actions:
1. After completing any code modifications to source files
2. Run `npm run build-dev` to test compilation
3. If build fails, fix the compilation errors before considering the task complete
4. Report build success or any compilation errors to the user

This ensures code quality and prevents runtime errors due to TypeScript/JavaScript compilation issues.

## Files this applies to:
- All TypeScript files (*.ts, *.tsx) 
- All JavaScript files (*.js, *.jsx)
- Source files in the `src/` directory and subdirectories
- Configuration files like [webpack.config.ts](mdc:webpack.config.ts) and [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
